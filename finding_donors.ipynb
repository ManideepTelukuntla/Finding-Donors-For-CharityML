    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "*  **Strengths**: \n",
    "   - Random Forest model train each weak learner on different features, which are randomly selected to overcome the problem with Decision Trees which tend to overfit the training data which results memorizing data instead of learning from it.\n",
    "*  **Weaknesses**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest models are not all that interpretable, they are like black boxes.\n",
    "   - For very large data sets, the size of the trees can take up a lot of memory.\n",
    "*  **Candidacy**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest were chosen because of their accuracy score considering the time taken to train and predict.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 2. Logistic Regression:\n",
    "*  **Application** : Logistic regression can be used to identify the factors that affect the survival of all cancer patients.\n",
    "(https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1039/1/012031/pdf)\n",
    "*  **Strengths**: \n",
    "   - Logistic Regression is easier to implement, interpret and very efficient to train.\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\n",
    "*  **Weaknesses**:\n",
    "   - Main limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",
    "*  **Candidacy**:\n",
    "   - In our problem we have binary output, hence Logistic Regression will be quick and simple to use.\n",

    "   - Gradient Boosting models are good at handling complex datasets with many features.\n",
    "*  **Weaknesses**:\n",
    "   - Gradient Boosting can be time consuming to train the model well as there are a large number of hyperparameters to train.\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "In order to understand the Gradient Boosting model we must know what are decision trees and ensemble models? So let's start by understanding decision trees and ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees:\n",
    "A decision tree is a super simple structure we use in our heads everyday. It’s just a representation of how we make decisions, like an if-this-then-that game. First, you start with a question. Then you write out possible answers to that question and some follow-up questions, until every question has an answer. Let us take an example to understand decision trees, in our example we have to decide wheather to play golf or not based on the weather conditions. Initially our tree will ask how's the \"outlook(sunny, overcast, rainy)\" if we reply with \"sunny\" again our tree will ask wheather it is \"humid\"? If we say yes our tree will suggest you not to play the golf and if we say it's \"not humid\" outside it will suggest you to play the golf. In the similar fashion our tree will ask questions for different outlooks and suggests you wheather to play golf or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you observe keenly, in decision trees lot of things are memorized instead of learning and this memorizing data in technical terms is called as overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble Models:\n",
    "To combat this overfitting, data scientists have come up with models called ensemble models. These models basically just lump many decision trees together and use their collective power to make a prediction that can withstand rigorous testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good example for ensemble model is a random forest. A random forest is a bunch of independent decision trees each contributing a “vote” to an prediction. E.g. if there are 50 trees, and 32 say “rainy” and 18 say “sunny”, then the score for “rainy” is 32/50, or 64,% and the score for a “sunny” is 18/50, or 36%. Since 64% > 36%, the forest has voted that they think it will rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add more decision trees to a random forest, they decide what they think independently of all the other trees. They learn on their own, and when it comes time to make a prediction, they all just throw their own uninfluenced opinion into the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "Now that you have learnt about decision trees and ensemble models. A gradient boosting model is a CHAIN of decision trees that also each make a vote. But instead of each learning in isolation, when you add a new one to the chain, it tries to improve a bit on what the rest of the chain already thinks. So, a new tree’s decision is influenced by all the trees that have already voiced an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a Random Forest, when you add a new tree to a gradien boosting model, it gets to see what its predecessors thought - and how they got it right or wrong. They then formulate a suggestion to correct the errors of their predecessors - and then they add that to the pot, and then the process continues with the next tree you add to the chain."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
